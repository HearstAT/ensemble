# Puma can serve each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
# The `threads` method setting takes two numbers a minimum and maximum.
# Any libraries that use thread pools should be configured to match
# the maximum value specified for Puma. Default is set to 5 threads for minimum
# and maximum, this matches the default thread size of Active Record.
#
threads_count = ENV.fetch('RAILS_MAX_THREADS') { 5 }.to_i

# Specifies the `port` that Puma will listen on to receive requests, default is 3000.
#
port        ENV.fetch('PORT') { 3000 }
# Bind on a specific TCP address. We won't bother using unix sockets because
# nginx will be running in a different Docker container.
# bind "tcp://#{ENV['BIND_ON']}"

# Specifies the `environment` that Puma will run in.
#
environment ENV.fetch('RAILS_ENV') { 'development' }

# Specifies the number of `workers` to boot in clustered mode.
# Workers are forked webserver processes. If using threads and workers together
# the concurrency of the application would be max `threads` * `workers`.
# Workers do not work on JRuby or Windows (both of which do not support
# processes).
#
workers ENV.fetch('WEB_CONCURRENCY') { 2 }

# An internal health check to verify that workers have checked in to the master
# process within a specific time frame. If this time is exceeded, the worker
# will automatically be rebooted. Defaults to 60s.
#
# Under most situations you will not have to tweak this value, which is why it
# is coded into the config rather than being an environment variable.
worker_timeout 30

# Use the `preload_app!` method when specifying a `workers` number.
# This directive tells Puma to first boot the application and load code
# before forking the application. This takes advantage of Copy On Write
# process behavior so workers use less memory. If you use this option
# you need to make sure to reconnect any threads in the `on_worker_boot`
# block.
#
# preload_app!

# The code in the `on_worker_boot` will be called if you are using
# clustered mode by specifying a number of `workers`. After each worker
# process is booted this block will be run, if you are using `preload_app!`
# option you will want to use this block to reconnect to any threads
# or connections that may have been created at application boot, Ruby
# cannot share connections between processes.

# Allow puma to be restarted by `rails restart` command.
